# Laboratory work 1 - Node.js
Лабораторна робота №1 студенток групи ІП-04, Легенької Юлії, Васильєвої Марини, Саніної Анастасії.

## Setup
1. Install Node JS

2. Clone the repository with the following command:
```bash
https://github.com/julikss/node.js-lab1.git
```

## Duplicate Encode
The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

To try it use the following command:
```bash
node duplicateEncode.js
```

## First Non Repeating Character
The goal of this exercise is to return the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string (upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter). If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string ("").

To try it use the following command:
```bash
node firstNonDuplicated.js
```

## Create Phone Number
The goal of this exercise is to write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number - '(xxx) xxx-xxxx'. The numbers can be in random sequence, but in correct format.

To try it use the following command:
```bash
node createPhoneNumber.js
```
